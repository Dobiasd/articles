# On feeling deceived when receiving (non-labeled) LLM-generated messages

Seeing LLM-generated articles or social media posts online is nothing new. We're used to fact-check things that are important to us, so we don't blindly believe factually wrong hallucinations of some GPT.

However, the more personal the communication becomes, the stronger I feel against receiving generated messages without them being labeled as such. As an extreme example, imagine you write about your feelings (about whatever) to your significant other, and they copy-paste your text to the LLM and prompt it to "please respond on my behalf". When you find out you might feel angry, sad, and deceived.

This extreme example shows that there is [more](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four-sides_model) to communication than just the factual information in a message. And this is not only true for love relationships. Also when you exchange texts with a friend or work colleague, and even if it's about a sober topic, as the recipient, you interpret the phrasing to learn about the sender's emotions when writing, what it says about your relationship, and what the intended appeal might be. When the message was not actually written by the alleged sender, but the recipient is not aware, this can lead to incorrect assumptions and expectations in the future, and to a false feeling of mutual understanding.

So, please, at least label LLM-generated messages as such when sending, especially when it's in a one-on-one communication setting, even if it's not a very intimate relationship.

And, yes, you can now play the reductio-ad-absurdum game and ask "What if only part of the message is generated, or what if I only used the LLM to improve the wording, or what if my text is self-written but contains ideas I got from an LLM? Do I have to add a disclaimer every time I use some minor piece of knowledge that I might have picked up from an LLM in the past?"

You don't *have* to do anything. It's on you to decide when you feel it's appropriate to be transparent about this. Try to empathize with whoever you communicate with. Trust is worth it in the long run.
